# system-health-check-dag

The Project implements a Python Web API that checks the health of a multi-level correlated system structured as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

Highlights:
- It Loads system relationships from a JSON file.
- It Traverses the graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- It Performs asynchronous health checks on each component.
- It Displays the health results in a table format.
- It Visualizes the DAG with failed components in red.
- Finally, It is Easily extendable and customizable.
